  "prompt": "Here is a detailed prompt for generating an image conceptually related to the article:\n\n\"A futuristic, close-up shot of a dairy farm at sunset, with a subtle gradient of blue and orange hues in the background. The foreground features a majestic cow gazing directly at the camera, with a subtle sheen on its coat to represent the luxurious quality of dairy products. In the distance, a sprawling cityscape with towering skyscrapers is visible, symbolizing the resurgence of the industry and its connection to urban markets. The cow's ears are adorned with tiny sensors, hinting at the integration of AI technology in the dairy industry.\n\nIn the top-left corner, a delicate, swirling pattern of milk droplets is subtly embossed on the image, echoing the article's focus on the revival of the dairy industry. The overall aesthetic is sleek, modern, and professional, with a color palette that blends warm earth tones with cool blues and oranges. The composition is deliberately symmetrical, with the cow serving as a central axis. The photograph is shallow, with a shallow depth of field to emphasize the textures and details of the cow's fur and the surrounding environment. The image should convey a sense of innovation, sustainability, and luxury, with a hint of cutting-edge technology and digital disruption.\"",
