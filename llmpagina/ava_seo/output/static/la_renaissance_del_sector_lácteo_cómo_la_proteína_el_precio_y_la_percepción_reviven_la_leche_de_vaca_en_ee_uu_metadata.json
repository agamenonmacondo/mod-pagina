  "prompt": "Here is a detailed prompt for generating an artistic image that accompanies the article:\n\n**Title:** \"Renaissance of the Dairy Sector: AI-Powered Revival\"\n\n**Concept:** A futuristic, surreal representation of the dairy sector's revival, symbolized by a metamorphosis from a withering, barren landscape to a vibrant, blooming ecosystem. The image should convey the themes of innovation, sustainability, and artificial intelligence.\n\n**Main Visual Elements:**\n\n* A majestic, glowing cow, representing the dairy sector's resurgence, emerges from the earth.\n* A network of tiny, glowing pixels and circuit boards radiates from the cow's body, symbolizing AI and technology.\n* A lush, green meadow surrounds the cow, representing growth, sustainability, and the dairy sector's new focus on environmental stewardship.\n* A subtle, 3D-like grid pattern in the background, evoking the idea of data and analysis, underscores the role of AI in the sector's revival.\n\n**Professional, Commercial, and Modern Artistic Style:**\n\n* Incorporate bold, contrasting colors, with a focus on blues, greens, and golds to represent technology, nature, and luxury.\n* Employ a mix of smooth, organic textures and sharp, geometric lines to create a futuristic, high-tech aesthetic.\n* Use subtle, gradient-like transitions to blend the different elements, creating a sense of depth and dimensionality.\n\n**Composition:**\n\n* The cow should dominate the center of the image, with the meadow and grid pattern radiating from its body.\n* Maintain a sense of balance and harmony between the different elements, with the glowing pixels and circuit boards adding a touch of dynamism and energy.\n\n**Photographic Style:**\n\n* Close-up, detailed shots of the cow, the meadow, and the grid pattern, with a shallow depth of field to emphasize the textures and details.\n* Utilize a mix of warm and cool lighting to create a sense of depth and atmosphere.\n\n**Color Palette:**\n\n* Blues: #3498db, #66ccff\n* Greens: #2ecc71, #8bc34a\n* Golds: #ffd700, #ffd700\n* Neutrals: #333333, #999999",
