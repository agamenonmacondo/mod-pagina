  "prompt": "Here is the prompt:\n\n\"Create a conceptual image that showcases the theme of 'Intelligence Artificial at the Center of the Scene'. The image should be visually striking, professional, and modern, with a palette of calming blues and whites to represent the cutting-edge technology. \n\nIn the foreground, depict a sleek, futuristic cityscape with towering skyscrapers and neon lights, symbolizing the fast-paced and innovative world of AI. In the center of the image, position a stylized, glowing orb with pulsing blue lights, representing the AI's presence. Surrounding the orb, illustrate various icons and symbols related to Microsoft and Google, such as their logos, cybersecurity and email correspondence elements, and algorithmic codes. \n\nIn the background, subtly blend in a cityscape with a river or lake, representing the connection between technology and nature. Use close-up shots to create a sense of intimacy and detail, with slight blur effects to convey the dynamic and futuristic feel. \nThe overall style should be reminiscent of futuristic sci-fi films, with a touch of commercial advertising flair. The image should be visually appealing, thought-provoking, and effectively communicate the theme of AI's impact on various sectors. \n\nNote: Include a mix of bright, neon blue and calming whites to create a sense of contrast and visual interest. Use bold, geometric shapes to highlight the AI orb and the computer-generated icons. Add subtle texture and shading to give the image depth and dimension.\"",
