        "content": "Your next guest will arrive at your hotel without ever having chosen you.\n\nWhile we've been obsessing over website conversion rates and mobile booking experiences, a seismic shift has been quietly building: the rise of agentic AI. It's not just another tech buzzword—it's the most profound disruption to hospitality distribution since online travel agencies emerged two decades ago.\n\nOpenAI's Operator isn't just impressive tech; it's the harbinger of an entirely new guest acquisition ecosystem. One where algorithms, not humans, make the decisions that fill your rooms.\n\nHere's what many are overlooking: this isn't fundamentally a technology story. It's a behavioral revolution that will transform how billions of global travelers discover, select, and experience accommodations.\n\nThe recent debut of tools like OpenAI's Operator—an AI agent capable of browsing websites, clicking buttons, and completing bookings—marks more than just another step forward in technology. It's a glimpse into a major transformation in how travelers and hotels will connect and interact.\n\nTo understand the impact, it’s important to grasp what \"agentic AI\" really means. Unlike familiar digital assistants like Alexa or ChatGPT that wait for us to give them commands, agentic AI takes things a step further. These AI agents don’t just respond—they act. They navigate the digital world independently, completing tasks without constant human direction, and delivering results as if they were a digital concierge working behind the scenes.\n\nPicture this: A guest’s AI agent keeps an eye on their travel calendar, notices an upcoming business trip to Berlin, and—based on past stays—automatically books their preferred room at their favorite hotel. It lines up airport transportation, reserves a table at restaurants that fit their dietary needs, and even sets the room temperature to their liking before they walk through the door. And the best part? The traveler never has to lift a finger.\n\nThis is where things are headed, and it will fundamentally change our industry, and guest behaviors in ways that hoteliers must prepare for. Let’s unpack the implications.\n\nThroughout technology history, new tools have created unexpected behavioral changes. The answering machine gave us call screening. Smartphones created constant connectivity. Social media transformed how we maintain relationships.\n\nAgentic AI will similarly reshape traveler behaviors in ways that will challenge traditional hospitality models:\n\nToday's travelers spend hours comparing hotels, reading reviews, and checking rates across multiple sites. In an agentic world, this behavior largely disappears. Guests will delegate these tasks to their AI, which will efficiently filter options based on previously established preferences.\n\nFor hotels, this means the traditional \"shopping\" phase of the customer journey—where brand impressions and emotional connections are often formed—could vanish entirely. The window to influence booking decisions will narrow dramatically or shift to entirely different touchpoints.\n\nOnce a traveler's AI agent knows they prefer corner rooms away from elevators, king beds with firm mattresses, and properties with 24-hour fitness centers, these preferences become remarkably sticky. The path of least resistance is to continue with what worked before.\n\nThis creates both opportunity and threat: Hotels that earn a place in a guest's preference profile gain tremendous loyalty advantages, while those trying to attract new guests face a steeper barrier to entry than ever before.\n\nAs humans, we make countless low-stakes decisions daily. What time to check in? Which restaurant to try? Standard room or upgrade? Agentic AI makes it effortless to offload these decisions.\n\nThe psychological impact will be profound. Travelers will arrive at properties with fewer decisions made consciously and more made algorithmically. This shift will increase expectations for frictionless experiences while potentially decreasing the emotional investment in those same experiences.\n\nHotel distribution has always involved intermediaries—from traditional travel agents to OTAs. AI agents represent the next evolution of intermediation, but with a critical difference: they serve the guest exclusively, not the hotel.\n\nThese AI agents won't be swayed by commissions, persuasive marketing, or emotional appeals. They'll optimize ruthlessly for their users' preferences, creating an entirely new dynamic in the booking ecosystem.\n\nHerein lies the central tension that hoteliers must navigate: While AI agents enable unprecedented personalization, they simultaneously risk commoditizing the hotel selection process.\n\nWhen AI agents make booking decisions based on explicitly defined criteria (location, price, amenities), they strip away the emotional and aspirational elements that have traditionally differentiated hotel brands. The story a hotel tells about itself matters less when an algorithm is the audience.\n\nYet paradoxically, these same agents create opportunities for hyper-personalization once a guest is on property. When a hotel knows exactly what a guest prefers—not just room type but temperature, lighting, minibar contents, and service style—it can deliver experiences tailored with remarkable precision.\n\nSo, how can hotels thrive in this new paradigm? The answer isn't simply adapting to AI agents, but rethinking the entire guest relationship in an agent-mediated world.\n\nThe first imperative is understanding what criteria AI agents use to make decisions. Hotels must gain visibility into these algorithmic preferences, which will vary by platform and evolve constantly. Success will require continuous monitoring and adaptation.\n\nSmart hoteliers will hire specialists dedicated to understanding AI agent behavior just as they currently employ revenue managers to understand pricing algorithms. These \"AI relationship managers\" will become as vital as traditional sales teams.\n\nHotels have traditionally sold bundled experiences—a room that comes with service levels, amenities, atmosphere, and location. AI agents excel at unbundling these elements to match precise preferences.\n\nForward-thinking properties will embrace this unbundling, allowing guests (via their agents) to precisely specify and pay for exactly what they value. The standard hotel rate card may give way to component pricing that better matches how AI agents evaluate options.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, hotels must recognize that influencing AI agents will require strategies that extend beyond the digital realm. When algorithms filter digital marketing, how do you break through?\n\nThe answer may lie in creating real-world experiences so remarkable that they override algorithmic defaults. A guest whose AI booked them at a predictable business hotel might be so impressed by a chance experience at a boutique property that they explicitly instruct their agent to prioritize that hotel for future trips, regardless of other factors.\n\nThe ultimate irony of the agentic AI revolution may be this: as more decisions become automated, the truly human elements of hospitality gain value.\n\nIn a world where AI handles the transactional aspects of travel, authentic human connection becomes the differentiator. The front desk agent who remembers a guest's name, the bartender who recalls a preferred drink, the housekeeper who notices and accommodates an unspoken preference—these human touches will stand in powerful contrast to the algorithmic efficiency governing the rest of the travel experience.\n\nHotels that view AI agents merely as a new booking channel will miss the deeper transformation occurring. This isn't just about adapting your distribution strategy—it's about rethinking the very nature of hospitality in an age where many guest interactions begin with algorithms rather than humans.\n\nRather than prescribing a one-size-fits-all approach to the agentic future, I encourage every hospitality leader to engage with these fundamental questions:\n\nThe hoteliers who thrive in the age of agentic AI won't be those with the most sophisticated technology stack or the biggest digital marketing budget. The winners will be those who understand how human behavior is changing and adapt their approach to hospitality accordingly.\n\nThe future isn't about competing with AI agents—it's about creating experiences so memorable that travelers specifically instruct their agents to seek you out. In a world of algorithmic efficiency, genuine hospitality becomes the ultimate differentiator.\n\nDownload the ultimate guide to choosing an AI-first hotel revenue management system.\n\nInfor is a global leader in business cloud software specialized by industry.
