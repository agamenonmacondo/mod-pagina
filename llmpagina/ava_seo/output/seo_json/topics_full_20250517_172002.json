        "content": "The titans of the tech industry say artificial intelligence will soon match the powers of humans’ brains. Are they underestimating us?\n\nCade Metz has covered the rise of artificial intelligence for more than 15 years.\n\nSam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, recently told President Trump during a private phone call that it would arrive before the end of his administration. Dario Amodei, the chief executive of Anthropic, OpenAI’s primary rival, repeatedly told podcasters it could happen even sooner. The tech billionaire Elon Musk has said it could be here before the end of the year.\n\nLike many other voices across Silicon Valley and beyond, these executives predict that the arrival of artificial general intelligence, or A.G.I., is imminent.\n\nSince the early 2000s, when a group of fringe researchers slapped the term on the cover of a book that described the autonomous computer systems they hoped to build one day, A.G.I. has served as shorthand for a future technology that achieves human-level intelligence. There is no settled definition of A.G.I., just an entrancing idea: an artificial intelligence that can match the many powers of the human mind.\n\nMr. Altman, Mr. Amodei and Mr. Musk have long chased this goal, as have executives and researchers at companies like Google and Microsoft. And thanks, in part, to their fervent pursuit of this ambitious idea, they have produced technologies that are changing the way hundreds of millions of people research, make art and program computers. These technologies are now poised to transform entire professions.\n\nBut since the arrival of chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and the rapid improvement of these strange and powerful systems over the last two years, many technologists have grown increasingly bold in predicting how soon A.G.I. will arrive. Some are even saying that once they deliver A.G.I., a more powerful creation called “superintelligence” will follow.\n\nAs these eternally confident voices predict the near future, their speculations are getting ahead of reality. And though their companies are pushing the technology forward at a remarkable rate, an army of more sober voices are quick to dispel any claim that machines will soon match human intellect.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

        "content": "Challenges in visual and spatial processing and a deficit in training data have revealed a surprising lack of timekeeping ability in AI systems\n\nNew research has revealed another set of tasks most humans can do with ease that artificial intelligence (AI) stumbles over — reading an analogue clock or figuring out the day on which a date will fall.\n\nAI may be able to write code, generate lifelike images, create human-sounding text and even pass exams (to varying degrees of success) yet it routinely misinterprets the position of hands on everyday clocks and fails at the basic arithmetic needed for calendar dates.\n\nResearchers revealed these unexpected flaws in a presentation at the 2025 International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR). They also published their findings March 18 on the preprint server arXiv, so they have not yet been peer-reviewed .\n\n\"Most people can tell the time and use calendars from an early age. Our findings highlight a significant gap in the ability of AI to carry out what are quite basic skills for people,\" study lead author Rohit Saxena, a researcher at the University of Edinburgh, said in a statement. These shortfalls must be addressed if AI systems are to be successfully integrated into time-sensitive, real-world applications, such as scheduling, automation and assistive technologies.\"\n\nTo investigate AI's timekeeping abilities, the researchers fed a custom dataset of clock and calendar images into various multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which can process visual as well as textual information. The models used in the study include Meta's Llama 3.2-Vision, Anthropic's Claude-3.5 Sonnet, Google's Gemini 2.0 and OpenAI's GPT-4o.\n\nAnd the results were poor, with the models being unable to identify the correct time from an image of a clock or the day of the week for a sample date more than half the time.\n\nRelated: Current AI models a 'dead end' for human-level intelligence, scientists agree\n\nGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nHowever, the researchers have an explanation for AI's surprisingly poor time-reading abilities.\n\n\"Early systems were trained based on labelled examples. Clock reading requires something different — spatial reasoning,\" Saxena said. \"The model has to detect overlapping hands, measure angles and navigate diverse designs like Roman numerals or stylized dials. AI recognizing that 'this is a clock' is easier than actually reading it.\"\n\nDates proved just as difficult. When given a challenge like \"What day will the 153rd day of the year be?,\" the failure rate was similarly high: AI systems read clocks correctly only 38.7% and calendars only 26.3%.\n\nThis shortcoming is similarly surprising because arithmetic is a fundamental cornerstone of computing, but as Saxena explained, AI uses something different. \"Arithmetic is trivial for traditional computers but not for large language models. AI doesn't run math algorithms, it predicts the outputs based on patterns it sees in training data,\" he said. So while it may answer arithmetic questions correctly some of the time, its reasoning isn't consistent or rule-based, and our work highlights that gap.\"\n\nThe project is the latest in a growing body of research that highlights the differences between the ways AI \"understands\" versus the way humans do. Models derive answers from familiar patterns and excel when there are enough examples in their training data, yet they fail when asked to generalize or use abstract reasoning.\n\n\"What for us is a very simple task like reading a clock may be very hard for them, and vice versa,\" Saxena said.\n\n—Scientists discover major differences in how humans and AI 'think' — and the implications could be significant\n\n—If any AI became 'misaligned' then the system would hide it just long enough to cause harm — controlling it is a fallacy\n\n—Researchers gave AI an 'inner monologue' and it massively improved its performance\n\nThe research also reveals the problem AI has when it's trained with limited data — in this case comparatively rare phenomena like leap years or obscure calendar calculations. Even though LLMs have plenty of examples that explain leap years as a concept, that doesn't mean they make the requisite connections required to complete a visual task.\n\nThe research highlights both the need for more targeted examples in training data and the need to rethink how AI handles the combination of logical and spatial reasoning, especially in tasks it doesn't encounter often.\n\nAbove all, it reveals one more area where entrusting AI output too much comes at our peril.\n\n\"AI is powerful, but when tasks mix perception with precise reasoning, we still need rigorous testing, fallback logic, and in many cases, a human in the loop,\" Saxena said.\n\nDrew is a freelance science and technology journalist with 20 years of experience.

        "content": "Your next guest will arrive at your hotel without ever having chosen you.\n\nWhile we've been obsessing over website conversion rates and mobile booking experiences, a seismic shift has been quietly building: the rise of agentic AI. It's not just another tech buzzword—it's the most profound disruption to hospitality distribution since online travel agencies emerged two decades ago.\n\nOpenAI's Operator isn't just impressive tech; it's the harbinger of an entirely new guest acquisition ecosystem. One where algorithms, not humans, make the decisions that fill your rooms.\n\nHere's what many are overlooking: this isn't fundamentally a technology story. It's a behavioral revolution that will transform how billions of global travelers discover, select, and experience accommodations.\n\nThe recent debut of tools like OpenAI's Operator—an AI agent capable of browsing websites, clicking buttons, and completing bookings—marks more than just another step forward in technology. It's a glimpse into a major transformation in how travelers and hotels will connect and interact.\n\nTo understand the impact, it’s important to grasp what \"agentic AI\" really means. Unlike familiar digital assistants like Alexa or ChatGPT that wait for us to give them commands, agentic AI takes things a step further. These AI agents don’t just respond—they act. They navigate the digital world independently, completing tasks without constant human direction, and delivering results as if they were a digital concierge working behind the scenes.\n\nPicture this: A guest’s AI agent keeps an eye on their travel calendar, notices an upcoming business trip to Berlin, and—based on past stays—automatically books their preferred room at their favorite hotel. It lines up airport transportation, reserves a table at restaurants that fit their dietary needs, and even sets the room temperature to their liking before they walk through the door. And the best part? The traveler never has to lift a finger.\n\nThis is where things are headed, and it will fundamentally change our industry, and guest behaviors in ways that hoteliers must prepare for. Let’s unpack the implications.\n\nThroughout technology history, new tools have created unexpected behavioral changes. The answering machine gave us call screening. Smartphones created constant connectivity. Social media transformed how we maintain relationships.\n\nAgentic AI will similarly reshape traveler behaviors in ways that will challenge traditional hospitality models:\n\nToday's travelers spend hours comparing hotels, reading reviews, and checking rates across multiple sites. In an agentic world, this behavior largely disappears. Guests will delegate these tasks to their AI, which will efficiently filter options based on previously established preferences.\n\nFor hotels, this means the traditional \"shopping\" phase of the customer journey—where brand impressions and emotional connections are often formed—could vanish entirely. The window to influence booking decisions will narrow dramatically or shift to entirely different touchpoints.\n\nOnce a traveler's AI agent knows they prefer corner rooms away from elevators, king beds with firm mattresses, and properties with 24-hour fitness centers, these preferences become remarkably sticky. The path of least resistance is to continue with what worked before.\n\nThis creates both opportunity and threat: Hotels that earn a place in a guest's preference profile gain tremendous loyalty advantages, while those trying to attract new guests face a steeper barrier to entry than ever before.\n\nAs humans, we make countless low-stakes decisions daily. What time to check in? Which restaurant to try? Standard room or upgrade? Agentic AI makes it effortless to offload these decisions.\n\nThe psychological impact will be profound. Travelers will arrive at properties with fewer decisions made consciously and more made algorithmically. This shift will increase expectations for frictionless experiences while potentially decreasing the emotional investment in those same experiences.\n\nHotel distribution has always involved intermediaries—from traditional travel agents to OTAs. AI agents represent the next evolution of intermediation, but with a critical difference: they serve the guest exclusively, not the hotel.\n\nThese AI agents won't be swayed by commissions, persuasive marketing, or emotional appeals. They'll optimize ruthlessly for their users' preferences, creating an entirely new dynamic in the booking ecosystem.\n\nHerein lies the central tension that hoteliers must navigate: While AI agents enable unprecedented personalization, they simultaneously risk commoditizing the hotel selection process.\n\nWhen AI agents make booking decisions based on explicitly defined criteria (location, price, amenities), they strip away the emotional and aspirational elements that have traditionally differentiated hotel brands. The story a hotel tells about itself matters less when an algorithm is the audience.\n\nYet paradoxically, these same agents create opportunities for hyper-personalization once a guest is on property. When a hotel knows exactly what a guest prefers—not just room type but temperature, lighting, minibar contents, and service style—it can deliver experiences tailored with remarkable precision.\n\nSo, how can hotels thrive in this new paradigm? The answer isn't simply adapting to AI agents, but rethinking the entire guest relationship in an agent-mediated world.\n\nThe first imperative is understanding what criteria AI agents use to make decisions. Hotels must gain visibility into these algorithmic preferences, which will vary by platform and evolve constantly. Success will require continuous monitoring and adaptation.\n\nSmart hoteliers will hire specialists dedicated to understanding AI agent behavior just as they currently employ revenue managers to understand pricing algorithms. These \"AI relationship managers\" will become as vital as traditional sales teams.\n\nHotels have traditionally sold bundled experiences—a room that comes with service levels, amenities, atmosphere, and location. AI agents excel at unbundling these elements to match precise preferences.\n\nForward-thinking properties will embrace this unbundling, allowing guests (via their agents) to precisely specify and pay for exactly what they value. The standard hotel rate card may give way to component pricing that better matches how AI agents evaluate options.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, hotels must recognize that influencing AI agents will require strategies that extend beyond the digital realm. When algorithms filter digital marketing, how do you break through?\n\nThe answer may lie in creating real-world experiences so remarkable that they override algorithmic defaults. A guest whose AI booked them at a predictable business hotel might be so impressed by a chance experience at a boutique property that they explicitly instruct their agent to prioritize that hotel for future trips, regardless of other factors.\n\nThe ultimate irony of the agentic AI revolution may be this: as more decisions become automated, the truly human elements of hospitality gain value.\n\nIn a world where AI handles the transactional aspects of travel, authentic human connection becomes the differentiator. The front desk agent who remembers a guest's name, the bartender who recalls a preferred drink, the housekeeper who notices and accommodates an unspoken preference—these human touches will stand in powerful contrast to the algorithmic efficiency governing the rest of the travel experience.\n\nHotels that view AI agents merely as a new booking channel will miss the deeper transformation occurring. This isn't just about adapting your distribution strategy—it's about rethinking the very nature of hospitality in an age where many guest interactions begin with algorithms rather than humans.\n\nRather than prescribing a one-size-fits-all approach to the agentic future, I encourage every hospitality leader to engage with these fundamental questions:\n\nThe hoteliers who thrive in the age of agentic AI won't be those with the most sophisticated technology stack or the biggest digital marketing budget. The winners will be those who understand how human behavior is changing and adapt their approach to hospitality accordingly.\n\nThe future isn't about competing with AI agents—it's about creating experiences so memorable that travelers specifically instruct their agents to seek you out. In a world of algorithmic efficiency, genuine hospitality becomes the ultimate differentiator.\n\nDownload the ultimate guide to choosing an AI-first hotel revenue management system.\n\nInfor is a global leader in business cloud software specialized by industry.
