        "title": "Artificial intelligence for streamflow prediction in river basins: a use case in Mar Menor | Scientific Reports",
        "content": "Scientific Reports volume 15, Article number: 19481 (2025) Cite this article Streamflow prediction is crucial for efficient water resource management, flood forecasting and environmental protection. This is even more important in areas particularly vulnerable to environmental changes such our study area—the Mar Menor basin in the Region of Murcia, Spain—with a specific emphasis on the Albujón watercourse, a significant contributor to the Mar Menor. Utilizing data from stream gauge stations, nearby rain gauge stations, and piezometers, our research forecasts streamflow at two critical points: “La Puebla” and “Desembocadura” along the watercourse. Targeting short-term forecasts of 1, 12, and 24 hours, our study employs Machine and Deep Learning techniques after data preprocessing, which includes station selection, data granularity adjustment, and feature selection. A state-of-the-art data augmentation technique was used to balance periods of low and high streamflow. Results show that Random Forest slightly outperforms LSTM for 1-hour forecasts (NSE > 0.89, MAE < 0.01), while Long Short Term Memory with data augmentation excels for 12 and 24-hour forecasts (NSE > 0.12, MAE < 0.05). This is noteworthy in areas with torrential rains causing rapid streamflow increases, a more challenging yet less studied scenario in forecasting. The findings contribute to addressing the challenges associated with streamflow prediction in vulnerable regions. Accurate and timely predictions of streamflow are essential to support informed decision-making processes1 for effective water resource management, flood forecasting, and environmental protection. These predictions are particularly crucial in regions like the Mar Menor basin in the Region of Murcia, Spain. This basin includes the Albujón watercourse, which stands out as one of the most critical contributors to the Mar Menor lagoon’s water quality and its ecological balance. The Albujón’s highly variable streamflow, characterized by torrential rains and low baseline flows, presents unique challenges for prediction, making it an ideal focus for this study. Traditional hydrological models, while foundational, often encounter limitations in capturing the intricate nonlinear relationships inherent in river systems. Variabilities arising from land use changes, precipitation patterns, and the dynamic interactions of surface and groundwater further compound the challenges of precise streamflow prediction. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, have shown considerable promise in overcoming these limitations. These techniques excel in identifying complex patterns in large datasets, making them particularly suitable for streamflow prediction in regions with challenging hydrological conditions2. Despite extensive research into hydrological modeling and AI applications in water management, studies explicitly focusing on short-term streamflow prediction in ephemeral or highly variable watercourses remain scarce. Existing works on the Mar Menor basin have predominantly addressed broader ecological concerns, such as eutrophication3, water quality monitoring, and lagoon dynamics4. While these studies underscore the basin’s environmental significance, they do not address the critical need for precise streamflow forecasts to manage water resource challenges effectively. The considerable volume of water that the Albujón watercourse carries, especially during periods of increased precipitation or runoff events and the fact that it reaches regions characterized by diverse land uses, including agricultural lands, urban areas, and natural habitats, makes it the most important contributor to the Lagoon in terms of water influx. In that sense, in this study, we focus on two of its critical points: “La Puebla” and “Desembocadura” for several horizons within 24 h. The structure of the paper is as follows: Section “Related work” analyzes and describes the state of the art regarding streamflow forecasting and the Mar Menor ecosystem. Then, in Sect. “Materials and methods” a detailed description of the study area is provided, the process of data collection and the ML algorithms used, and Sect. “Methodology” presents our AI-based methodology. Section “Experiments and results” describes the results of the models applied to the locations of interest. The paper concludes in Sect. “Conclusions and future work” and suggests future lines of research. Predicting streamflow in river basins is a crucial task in hydrology, necessary for efficient water resource management, flood forecasting, and environmental protection. The field has experienced a paradigm shift from traditional hydrological models to more advanced, data-driven approaches, thanks to the advent of sophisticated computational techniques. This section reviews recent advancements in streamflow prediction, highlighting the methodologies, achievements, and challenges in this field. The application of AI has become increasingly popular in the past two decades as it has exhibited significant progress in forecasting and modeling non-linear hydrological applications. Reference2 identified Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and other ML algorithms as suitable for capturing the complexity inherent in hydrological data. In addition, the review from5 compared ANNs, SVMs and Adaptative Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) to traditional physics-deterministic models, concluding that AI-based modeling frameworks are overcoming the limitations faced by traditional methods. Afterward6, highlighted the transition from basic ML models to more sophisticated hybrid, modular and ensemble approaches. Hence, enhanced ML algorithms and the newer DL approaches seem to be the most promising ways for the purpose of streamflow predictions. The Mar Menor lagoon and its surrounding areas have been extensively studied across various ecological disciplines. In7, the lagoon was analyzed to mitigate issues such as eutrophication, a topic also explored by8 in its estimates of chlorophyll-a levels. Additional research has already been conducted using satellite imagery to address eutrophication, map the distribution of water quality indicators, and assess dissolved oxygen levels4,9,10. Therefore, numerous studies have been conducted on the Mar Menor coastal lagoon and its surrounding ecosystem, and while some of these utilize ML and AI, none specifically focuses on predicting streamflow. Streamflow forecasting involves a wide range of methodologies and contexts, including various locations, features, time horizons, data sources, and algorithms. Streamflow prediction models are applied across diverse geographical settings, from snow-fed rivers in mountainous regions to rain-dependent streams in flatlands, each with its unique hydrological characteristics. These models incorporate different features to provide a comprehensive view of the factors that influence river behaviour. The time horizons for predictions vary significantly, ranging from short-term forecasts crucial for flood management to long-term projections essential for water resource planning. The models rely on a variety of data sources, such as in-situ measurements, remote sensing data, and historical hydrological records. The complexity and adaptability of streamflow prediction models are underscored by the rich diversity in locations, features, time horizons, data sources, and algorithms. These models cater to the specific needs and challenges of different hydrological environments. In the following paragraphs, the literature that addresses these factors is reviewed, commencing with publications that investigate larger time horizons and progressing to those focused on shorter durations. Beginning with forecasts for extended prediction horizons, Liu et al.11 explores the application of the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) for long-term streamflow forecasting, specifically over a one-year period. The study compares the performance of RVM with that of Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a model commonly used in hydrology and water resources research, as discussed below. Similarly, in their study on long-term forecasting, Waqas et al.12 collected data from up to eight stations along the basin and employed algorithms such as Tree Boost (TB), Decision Tree Forest (DTF), Single Decision Tree (SDT), and Multilayer Perceptron Network (MLP) to generate predictions with both annual and seasonal time horizons. Monthly time horizons are widely used in streamflow forecasting, particularly in studies with sufficient data availability. Yaseen et al.13 explores the potential of the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for forecasting monthly streamflow discharge rates and compares its performance to that of Support Vector Regression (SVR) and the Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN). Other AI techniques, such as ANFIS and ANN, are incorporated by14 for the same purpose. Similar to the previous study, prior streamflow values were used as inputs, but cyclic terms were also included. In another comparison of ML techniques, Patel and Ramachandran15 uses daily discharge as input for Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), ANN, and SVR, concluding that ARIMA models were less effective in capturing nonlinear dynamics compared to SVR and ANN. This aligns with the findings of16, which conclude that ARIMA underestimates real runoff. Other studies also explore the monthly time horizon but with enhanced variations of ML algorithms. Mohammadi et al.17 evaluates the performance of two process-driven conceptual rainfall-runoff models and several hybrid models based on AI methods for simulating streamflow, using streamflow and precipitation data as inputs. Although AI demonstrated better overall performance, hybrid models improved streamflow accuracy in watersheds with limited data. In18, a selection of lagged streamflow values is taken as input from 1 up to 24 months, demonstrating the potential of fuzzy logic when using only lags from the target variable, especially for low flows. A different approach is presented in19, which incorporates different timescales of the data to represent seasonality and irregularity, resulting in improved forecasting performance for peak values with a modified ANN. Continuing with the improvement of ML techniques, Guo et al.20 modifies a SVM to enhance its resilience to noise in the streamflow time series. Further improving SVMs, Luo et al.16 proposes a framework that integrates factor analysis, time series decomposition, data regression, and error suppression to enhance the accuracy of monthly streamflow forecasting.

Become a Motley Fool member today to\n       get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources,\n       and more. Learn More\n\nThese two stocks are poised for strong returns over the next year, while Palantir must justify its valuation.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has been the driving force behind the stock market's gains since the release of ChatGPT in November 2022.\n\nFew companies have benefited more from the advancements and excitement around generative AI than Palantir Technologies (PLTR -7.78%). Palantir's financial results have been fantastic as it expands its customer base and use cases within enterprises. Those results were boosted by Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which makes it easy to glean new insights from big data sets. As a result, the company's stock has climbed 1,630% since December 2022 and sports a market cap of over $300 billion, as of this writing. Palantir is now one of the most valuable companies in the world.\n\nBut a couple of other AI innovators could overtake it within the next year. Here are two AI stocks I think will be worth more than Palantir in the near future.\n\nAs mentioned, Palantir has produced excellent financial results. Its AIP makes it easier for nontechnical users to take advantage of its core software, which helps businesses and governments make decisions and gain insights based on large, often disparate datasets. As a result, more businesses can use Palantir, and more people and departments within each business can use it.\n\nThat's led to strong revenue growth over the last few years. Revenue grew 39% year over year in the first quarter. Moreover, as a software company, Palantir's able to produce tremendous operating leverage, since the marginal cost of taking on another customer is minimal.\n\nAs a result, operating margin expanded to 44% last quarter. Management expects to produce that level of profitability for the full year as well.\n\nThere's no doubt Palantir's producing excellent operating results. The challenge for the stock is its valuation. Shares currently trade for more than 75 times management's outlook for 2025 revenue. Its enterprise value is 175 times analyst expectations for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) over the next 12 months. Analysts put a median price target of $100 per share on Palantir, a 24% drop from its current price. Only a handful rate the stock \"overweight\" or \"buy.\" To say that it's expensive may be an understatement.\n\nMeanwhile, these two stocks look undervalued despite the potential for AI to help grow their businesses substantially over the next few years.\n\nSalesforce (CRM 1.34%) is looking to take its dominant position in enterprise software solutions for sales and marketing, customer service, and data management, and help businesses harness the power of AI within those systems. Its solution is called Agentforce, which rolled out late last year. Agentforce allows businesses to use their data and systems to create AI agents that can make decisions and take actions without human intervention.\n\nThe company has signed around 8,000 Agentforce contracts as of the end of May. It's producing annual recurring revenue of around $100 million. When combined with its data management solutions, it's a $1 billion business just a few months after launching.\n\nThat said, it's still just a small part of Salesforce's overall business. Management expects sales to top $41 billion this year, with an operating margin of 34%. That's supported by stable subscription revenue from its core enterprise software offerings.\n\nDespite strong earnings results and raising its full-year outlook last month, investors sent the stock price lower following its most recent earnings report. There could be a couple of reasons. Management announced the acquisition of Informatica for $8 billion, increasing execution risk for the business. If the acquisition doesn't meaningfully accelerate its data management business, investors could see it as a waste of money.\n\nThe other detail that came in below expectations was its remaining performance obligations. But strong uptake in Agentforce and management increasing its full-year guidance should offset the weakness there.\n\nSalesforce stock currently trades for just 6 times management's revenue guidance. Its forward P/E ratio of just 23 looks very attractive. Analysts seem to agree, putting a median price target of $355 on the stock, a 35% upside from its price as of this writing. That could put the company's value well over $300 billion within a year.\n\nAdobe (ADBE 0.29%) has taken innovations in AI over the last few years and applied them to its own products across both its creative suite of software (Photoshop, Lightroom, Premiere Pro, etc.) and its marketing, analytics, and productivity software (Acrobat, e-signing, etc.). It touts its FireFly model as \"commercial safe,\" meaning it was trained on stock images and data that users can freely publish to their own websites and other online accounts.\n\nAdobe's AI integrations have helped it increase pricing for its software, but they also provide new opportunities to bring in customers. It integrated AI with Adobe Express, its online creative service, and it's seen an uptick in new customer accounts and conversion from free accounts to paid accounts. It also introduced GenStudio, which combines its creative and marketing software and allows users to create new ad campaigns and managing existing ones using natural language prompts.\n\nManagement says it ended the first quarter with $125 million in annual recurring revenue, directly attributable to AI services. It expects that number to double by year-end. But more impressive is the $3.5 billion in AI-influenced annual recurring revenue across its existing portfolio. That stems from increased retention rates and higher revenue per user. That's already a significant chunk of the businesses' $23 billion annual revenue, and it's growing quickly.\n\nMany investors see generative AI as a significant threat to Adobe's creative software. But Adobe is fully entrenched in the creative business, and there's a strong network effect and high switching costs involved with leaving the ecosystem. Understanding how to use Adobe's creative software is practically a requirement for any designer, photographer, or film editor. As Adobe continues to advance its own AI capabilities, it stands to strengthen its competitive moat.\n\nAdobe stock trades for about 7 times management's estimate for 2025 revenue. Its forward P/E sits below 20. Meanwhile, management's outlook for the next three years suggests double-digit revenue growth while exhibiting operating leverage.\n\nAt its current price, the stock looks like a bargain. The median price target on Wall Street is $477.50, implying 19% upside from the stock price, as of this writing. I believe the upside could be even greater, based on strong earnings growth and multiple expansion, and the company could be worth closer to $250 billion within a year.\n\nAdam Levy has positions in Adobe and Salesforce.
