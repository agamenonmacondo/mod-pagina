        "content": "Scientific Reports volume 15, Article number: 19481 (2025) Cite this article Streamflow prediction is crucial for efficient water resource management, flood forecasting and environmental protection. This is even more important in areas particularly vulnerable to environmental changes such our study area—the Mar Menor basin in the Region of Murcia, Spain—with a specific emphasis on the Albujón watercourse, a significant contributor to the Mar Menor. Utilizing data from stream gauge stations, nearby rain gauge stations, and piezometers, our research forecasts streamflow at two critical points: “La Puebla” and “Desembocadura” along the watercourse. Targeting short-term forecasts of 1, 12, and 24 hours, our study employs Machine and Deep Learning techniques after data preprocessing, which includes station selection, data granularity adjustment, and feature selection. A state-of-the-art data augmentation technique was used to balance periods of low and high streamflow. Results show that Random Forest slightly outperforms LSTM for 1-hour forecasts (NSE > 0.89, MAE < 0.01), while Long Short Term Memory with data augmentation excels for 12 and 24-hour forecasts (NSE > 0.12, MAE < 0.05). This is noteworthy in areas with torrential rains causing rapid streamflow increases, a more challenging yet less studied scenario in forecasting. The findings contribute to addressing the challenges associated with streamflow prediction in vulnerable regions. Accurate and timely predictions of streamflow are essential to support informed decision-making processes1 for effective water resource management, flood forecasting, and environmental protection. These predictions are particularly crucial in regions like the Mar Menor basin in the Region of Murcia, Spain. This basin includes the Albujón watercourse, which stands out as one of the most critical contributors to the Mar Menor lagoon’s water quality and its ecological balance. The Albujón’s highly variable streamflow, characterized by torrential rains and low baseline flows, presents unique challenges for prediction, making it an ideal focus for this study. Traditional hydrological models, while foundational, often encounter limitations in capturing the intricate nonlinear relationships inherent in river systems. Variabilities arising from land use changes, precipitation patterns, and the dynamic interactions of surface and groundwater further compound the challenges of precise streamflow prediction. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, have shown considerable promise in overcoming these limitations. These techniques excel in identifying complex patterns in large datasets, making them particularly suitable for streamflow prediction in regions with challenging hydrological conditions2. Despite extensive research into hydrological modeling and AI applications in water management, studies explicitly focusing on short-term streamflow prediction in ephemeral or highly variable watercourses remain scarce. Existing works on the Mar Menor basin have predominantly addressed broader ecological concerns, such as eutrophication3, water quality monitoring, and lagoon dynamics4. While these studies underscore the basin’s environmental significance, they do not address the critical need for precise streamflow forecasts to manage water resource challenges effectively. The considerable volume of water that the Albujón watercourse carries, especially during periods of increased precipitation or runoff events and the fact that it reaches regions characterized by diverse land uses, including agricultural lands, urban areas, and natural habitats, makes it the most important contributor to the Lagoon in terms of water influx. In that sense, in this study, we focus on two of its critical points: “La Puebla” and “Desembocadura” for several horizons within 24 h. The structure of the paper is as follows: Section “Related work” analyzes and describes the state of the art regarding streamflow forecasting and the Mar Menor ecosystem. Then, in Sect. “Materials and methods” a detailed description of the study area is provided, the process of data collection and the ML algorithms used, and Sect. “Methodology” presents our AI-based methodology. Section “Experiments and results” describes the results of the models applied to the locations of interest. The paper concludes in Sect. “Conclusions and future work” and suggests future lines of research. Predicting streamflow in river basins is a crucial task in hydrology, necessary for efficient water resource management, flood forecasting, and environmental protection. The field has experienced a paradigm shift from traditional hydrological models to more advanced, data-driven approaches, thanks to the advent of sophisticated computational techniques. This section reviews recent advancements in streamflow prediction, highlighting the methodologies, achievements, and challenges in this field. The application of AI has become increasingly popular in the past two decades as it has exhibited significant progress in forecasting and modeling non-linear hydrological applications. Reference2 identified Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and other ML algorithms as suitable for capturing the complexity inherent in hydrological data. In addition, the review from5 compared ANNs, SVMs and Adaptative Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) to traditional physics-deterministic models, concluding that AI-based modeling frameworks are overcoming the limitations faced by traditional methods. Afterward6, highlighted the transition from basic ML models to more sophisticated hybrid, modular and ensemble approaches. Hence, enhanced ML algorithms and the newer DL approaches seem to be the most promising ways for the purpose of streamflow predictions. The Mar Menor lagoon and its surrounding areas have been extensively studied across various ecological disciplines. In7, the lagoon was analyzed to mitigate issues such as eutrophication, a topic also explored by8 in its estimates of chlorophyll-a levels. Additional research has already been conducted using satellite imagery to address eutrophication, map the distribution of water quality indicators, and assess dissolved oxygen levels4,9,10. Therefore, numerous studies have been conducted on the Mar Menor coastal lagoon and its surrounding ecosystem, and while some of these utilize ML and AI, none specifically focuses on predicting streamflow. Streamflow forecasting involves a wide range of methodologies and contexts, including various locations, features, time horizons, data sources, and algorithms. Streamflow prediction models are applied across diverse geographical settings, from snow-fed rivers in mountainous regions to rain-dependent streams in flatlands, each with its unique hydrological characteristics. These models incorporate different features to provide a comprehensive view of the factors that influence river behaviour. The time horizons for predictions vary significantly, ranging from short-term forecasts crucial for flood management to long-term projections essential for water resource planning. The models rely on a variety of data sources, such as in-situ measurements, remote sensing data, and historical hydrological records. The complexity and adaptability of streamflow prediction models are underscored by the rich diversity in locations, features, time horizons, data sources, and algorithms. These models cater to the specific needs and challenges of different hydrological environments. In the following paragraphs, the literature that addresses these factors is reviewed, commencing with publications that investigate larger time horizons and progressing to those focused on shorter durations. Beginning with forecasts for extended prediction horizons, Liu et al.11 explores the application of the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) for long-term streamflow forecasting, specifically over a one-year period. The study compares the performance of RVM with that of Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a model commonly used in hydrology and water resources research, as discussed below. Similarly, in their study on long-term forecasting, Waqas et al.12 collected data from up to eight stations along the basin and employed algorithms such as Tree Boost (TB), Decision Tree Forest (DTF), Single Decision Tree (SDT), and Multilayer Perceptron Network (MLP) to generate predictions with both annual and seasonal time horizons. Monthly time horizons are widely used in streamflow forecasting, particularly in studies with sufficient data availability. Yaseen et al.13 explores the potential of the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for forecasting monthly streamflow discharge rates and compares its performance to that of Support Vector Regression (SVR) and the Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN). Other AI techniques, such as ANFIS and ANN, are incorporated by14 for the same purpose. Similar to the previous study, prior streamflow values were used as inputs, but cyclic terms were also included. In another comparison of ML techniques, Patel and Ramachandran15 uses daily discharge as input for Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), ANN, and SVR, concluding that ARIMA models were less effective in capturing nonlinear dynamics compared to SVR and ANN. This aligns with the findings of16, which conclude that ARIMA underestimates real runoff. Other studies also explore the monthly time horizon but with enhanced variations of ML algorithms. Mohammadi et al.17 evaluates the performance of two process-driven conceptual rainfall-runoff models and several hybrid models based on AI methods for simulating streamflow, using streamflow and precipitation data as inputs. Although AI demonstrated better overall performance, hybrid models improved streamflow accuracy in watersheds with limited data. In18, a selection of lagged streamflow values is taken as input from 1 up to 24 months, demonstrating the potential of fuzzy logic when using only lags from the target variable, especially for low flows. A different approach is presented in19, which incorporates different timescales of the data to represent seasonality and irregularity, resulting in improved forecasting performance for peak values with a modified ANN. Continuing with the improvement of ML techniques, Guo et al.20 modifies a SVM to enhance its resilience to noise in the streamflow time series. Further improving SVMs, Luo et al.16 proposes a framework that integrates factor analysis, time series decomposition, data regression, and error suppression to enhance the accuracy of monthly streamflow forecasting.

        "content": "Demis Hassabis, head of Google DeepMind, says he wants AI to clear inboxes by making ‘some of the easier decisions’\n\nThe march of artificial intelligence is predicted to bring monumental changes on a par with the advent of the internet or even the Industrial Revolution. But before all that, one of the technology’s leading figures wants it to solve a more urgent problem – the tyranny of the email inbox.\n\nDemis Hassabis, the head of Google DeepMind, has revealed he and his team are working on “next-generation email” that will deal with the daily grind of sorting through emails, replying to the most mundane ones and avoiding the need to apologise profusely for missing an important message.\n\nHassabis was speaking at the SXSW London festival about the extraordinary growth and potential of AI. He said its impact was “overhyped in the short term”, but would lead to profound longer-term changes to society.\n\nHowever, he said before the technology was ready to cure all known diseases or solve the climate crisis, he was putting it to work on the world’s email backlogs. “The thing I really want – and we’re working on – is can we have a next-generation email,” he said. “I would love to get rid of my email. I would pay thousands of dollars per month to get rid of that.”\n\nAsked exactly what he had in mind, he said he planned “something that would just understand what are the bread-and-butter emails, and answer in your style – and maybe make some of the easier decisions”.\n\nHassabis said he could also see AI being used to protect people from other algorithms designed by big tech to drain their attention away from more important tasks. “I’m very excited about the idea of a universal AI assistant that knows you really well, enriches your life by maybe giving you amazing recommendations, and helps to take care of mundane chores for you,” he said.\n\n“[It] basically gives you more time and maybe protects your attention from other algorithms trying to gain your attention. I think we can actually use AI in service of the individual.”\n\nHassabis said he had initially anticipated that the battle to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI) – a more human-like cognition that is able to work on a wide range of tasks – would be driven by scientific academia. However, he said its applications had been so immediate that big companies had become involved much earlier than he thought.\n\nWith continuing concerns about the dangers posed by AGI, he called on the US and China to cooperate over its development, which has been turning into a race between companies and countries.\n\n“I hope at least on the scientific level and a safety level we can find some common ground, because in the end it’s for the good of all of humanity,” he said. “It’s going to affect the whole of humanity.”\n\nHe said an AGI was about five to 10 years away. “That is very short if you think about how momentous a moment that will be,” he said. “I think it’ll be nothing short of a new Industrial Revolution, effectively. For something this fundamental, I think it’s important to try to have as much foresight ahead of time as you can.”\n\nThere remain serious concerns about the impact of AI on jobs. However, Hassabis said there were versions of an “AI utopia” in which “radical abundance” was created, as the technology solved issues around energy production and consumption. He called on academics to think about the consequences.\n\n“Even in the good case where we get radical abundance and economic prosperity, can we make sure that’s fairly shared, and fairly distributed,” he said. “These kinds of things need to be thought through. I hope economists are thinking about that and I encourage them to be thinking about that – and social scientists.”",
