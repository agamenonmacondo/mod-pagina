        "content": "The human brain can make sense of sentences — even when the vowels are missing.\n\n\"Ths sntnc s mssng ts vwls.\" You likely figured out the words — \"this sentence is missing its vowels\" — even though they're lacking several letters of the alphabet.\n\nYour brain does not read words letter by letter, experts told Live Science. Instead, it looks for patterns, considers context then makes predictions. So even if a word is misspelled or missing its vowels, your brain should be able to figure it out.\n\n\"We don't passively receive sentences, but actively predict them,\" David Eagleman, a neuroscientist at Stanford University, told Live Science in an email. \"Our brains aren't blank slates waiting for input; they are model builders, constantly generating internal expectations about what's out there.\"\n\nWhen vowels are missing, your brain leans on past experience and context. It makes guesses based on common letter combinations, your knowledge of the language, as well as surrounding words.\n\nAccording to Eagleman, this phenomenon also explains why you can recognize a friend in dim lighting. Even though the incoming sensory information is incomplete, your brain fills in the gaps. \"It uses what's available and compares it against a vast internal library of patterns it has learned over time,\" Eagleman said.\n\nGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nAlex White, an assistant professor of neuroscience at Barnard College in New York, told Live Science that there are many stages involved in recognizing words.\n\nAs with all vision, your eyes first detect the object — in this case, the basic shapes of the letters. That information is sent to the visual cortex, the outer layer of gray matter at the back of your brain, which processes the edges and curves of letters. Deeper in the brain, some regions appear to identify specific letters and letter combinations called bigrams — pairs of letters that appear next to each other in a word, like \"th\" or \"er.\" From there, the information moves to a specialized area in the left fusiform gyrus known as the visual word form area (VWFA).\n\nThe fusiform gyrus is a large structure that spans both brain hemispheres on the underside of the temporal and occipital lobes. It plays an important role in processing complex visual information. In most people, the right fusiform gyrus is responsible for face and object recognition, while the left side is home to the VWFA, which plays a key role in recognizing letter patterns and words.\n\nResearchers have performed studies where they scanned the brains of young children, Jin Li, a postdoctoral researcher in cognitive neuroscience at Georgia Tech, told Live Science. These experiments involved trying to capture the time window before and after the kids learn to read. \"They can see this nice emerging VWFA after they start school,\" she said.\n\nWith practice and exposure, the VWFA becomes tuned to the language you read, making it incredibly good at spotting meaningful combinations of letters, even when letters are missing. For example, Hebrew is mostly written without vowels, and fluent readers can still understand the text with ease.\n\nCommonly combined letters are likely a big piece of the puzzle in how we can read words without vowels.\n\n\"One theory is that at the next stage after the visual cortex registers the letters, neurons in your brain light up when particular letter combinations are present, not entire words,\" explained White. \"The letter combinations that are detected could be pairs or triplets of letters that are common in your language, and then those might activate a part of your brain that recognizes the whole word.\"\n\nThose letter combinations, the bigrams, are likely important building blocks that are used to recognize familiar letter patterns, especially during the early stages of learning to read. Think Wordle. If you identify an \"l\" in the fourth spot, and you are looking for likely letters for the fifth spot, you might consider \"y\" because \"ly\" is a common bigram.\n\nConsonants partially activate several words in your mind, but then you go with the one that's most likely based on the context.\n\nAfter reading \"Y cn rd sntncs wtht vwls\", your brain comes up with several possible candidates and relatively quickly settles on the one that makes the most sense in the sentence. It's mental auto-complete.\n\nPeople often use abbreviations made up mostly of consonants rather than vowels — such as bldg. or Dr. — because we're naturally good at recognizing these patterns, Li pointed out. \"People seem to agree on how to abbreviate a word, and it usually does not include vowels.\" Simply put: we reverse-engineer a word from the abbreviation when vowels are missing.\n\n—What happens in our brains when we 'hear' our own thoughts?\n\n—Could we ever retrieve memories from a dead person's brain?\n\n—Can minds persist when they are cut off from the world?\n\nAfter years of reading, you've absorbed the patterns of your language. You've learned which letters tend to go together and which words fit in which situations. You can read without vowels because your brain is not just reading, it is reconstructing.\n\n\"Our expectation-driven perception is what makes us such powerful recognizers,\" Eagleman said, \"even when the data is corrupted.\"\n\nRoberta McLain is a science writer and science teacher based north of Boston, Massachusetts. She received her master's degree in science writing from Johns Hopkins, a master's degree in biology from the University of New Hampshire, and a bachelor’s degree in biology and psychology from Union College, Schenectady, New York.

        "title": "Practical AI application in psychiatry: historical review and future directions | Molecular Psychiatry",
        "content": "Molecular Psychiatry (2025)Cite this article The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in mental healthcare holds promise for enhancing diagnostic precision, treatment efficacy, and personalized care. Despite AI’s potential to analyze vast datasets and identify subtle patterns, its clinical adoption in psychiatry remains limited. This review critically examines the emerging role of AI in psychiatry, elucidating its utility, challenges, and implications for clinical practice. Through an extensive analysis of the existing literature and empirical evidence, we seek to inform psychiatric stakeholders about both opportunities and obstacles that are presented by AI. We evaluate AI’s potential to improve diagnostic accuracy, prognostic performance, and therapeutic interventions. Our pragmatic approach bridges the gap between theoretical advancements and practical implementation, providing valuable insights and actionable recommendations for psychiatric professionals. This article highlights the supportive role of AI, advocating for its judicious integration to enhance patient outcomes while maintaining the human-centric essence of psychiatric practice. By addressing these challenges and fostering collaboration, AI can significantly advance mental healthcare, reduce clinical burdens, and improve patient outcomes. Mental health is a global priority, with such disorders as anxiety and depression affecting 29% of the global population during their lifetime, as recognized by the World Health Organization [1, 2]. Beyond personal impacts, these disorders incur an estimated USD$1 trillion in global economic costs annually [2]. Traditionally, mental health diagnosis and treatment have relied heavily on the experiential knowledge and judgments of human physicians. However, the increasing complexity of mental healthcare, compounded by a proliferation of diagnostic tests, a growing body of biomedical and clinical evidence, and the challenges of managing comorbidities in aging populations, necessitates novel approaches [3]. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), conceptually suggested by Alan Turing and coined by Arthur Samuel in the 1950s, have the potential to transform mental healthcare by enhancing diagnostic and treatment processes through advanced data analysis [4]. Artificial intelligence systems can process and analyze vast datasets, identify subtle patterns, and generate predictions that might elude human clinicians [5]. This technology has the potential to facilitate earlier detection, more accurate diagnosis, individualized interventions, and streamlined service delivery through automation (Fig. 1). However, the inherent complexity of mental health conditions, nuances of patient interactions, subjective judgement and the empathy to integrate to psychiatric practice, pose significant difficulties with AI replication. This discrepancy highlights a significant gap between theoretical advancements and practical implementation. Despite a quickly growing body of research in AI application to health care, the potential of AI to fully replace the role of clinicians in diagnosing and making treatment decisions, remains currently unrealistic. Consequently, the most efficient and impactful approach to integrating AI into clinical practice is to employ it as a supportive tool to enhance clinical decision-making. By offering data-driven insights, predictive analytics, and the automation of routine tasks, AI can assist clinicians in making more informed decisions, thereby improving patient outcomes while allowing physicians to concentrate on humanistic care. Data flow from multimodal sources through preprocessing and AI-based modeling using a transformer architecture. The model consists of input embedding, encoding, and decoding stages utilizing multi-head attention and feed-forward layers, residual layer normalization, and a linear output layer. Patient feedback informs model optimization and updates, and pattern recognition and prediction support clinical practice through diagnostic support, treatment recommendations, prognostic prediction, and ongoing monitoring. Realizing the potential benefits of AI for clinical practice necessitates a comprehensive understanding of its merits and limitations within clinical settings [6]. The dichotomy between AI’s potential and its practical applications presents a formidable challenge, underscoring the need for physicians to have a deep understanding of its mechanisms and potential clinical applications, as well as related clinical measurements and performance metrics. Psychiatric practitioners and researchers must thoroughly grasp these tasks to effectively assign, monitor, and evaluate AI-assisted interventions. The present review aims to elucidate the current landscape of AI applications in mental health from the perspective of psychiatry physicians. We assess AI’s potential to enhance diagnostic precision, prognostic performance, treatment efficacy, and the development of interventions, such as precision treatment, chatbots, and digital monitoring. By bridging the gap between research and clinical application, this review seeks to illuminate new possibilities for clinicians who are unfamiliar with AI. We illustrate how AI can alleviate clinical burdens and ultimately foster more effective and efficient mental healthcare (Fig. 2). Synergy between clinical expertise and analytical capabilities of AI for optimized patient care. The accuracy of AI diagnostics in psychiatric diseases across various population datasets has shown promising yet variable results. The efficacy of AI for psychiatric diagnosis processes is contingent upon the quality and the extent of the data that are utilized, as well as the individual psychiatric condition. Current research indicates that ML models can reach diagnostic accuracies of 48.1–62.0% when applied to comprehensive multivariate neuroimaging data and polygenic risk scores [7]. AI models may at times outperform random guessing for diagnostic accuracy, but only by a modest margin. Thus, their true strength appears to be in their ability to process and analyze vast amounts of multimodal data, revealing latent patterns that are not easily discernible to human clinicians [8]. While AI may enhance diagnostic processes and support clinical decision-making, it currently remains an adjunct rather than a replacement for traditional diagnostic methods. Currently, the primary methods for diagnosing mental illness predominantly rely on self-reported questionnaires and clinical assessments, as outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition [9]. However, psychiatric illnesses are inherently heterogeneous and not manifest uniformly across subjects. Thus, patients with the same condition can exhibit widely divergent symptom profiles [10]. Also, the subjective nature of information often introduces limitations, such as inaccuracies and inherent biases. AI algorithms are effective in revealing latent patterns within complex datasets and furthermore own the ability for continual learning and adaptation through exposure to new data. This can contribute to enhancing diagnostic accuracy and efficacy over time, enabling a deeper understanding of neurobiological substrates of psychiatric disorders and refining diagnostic precision [11]. ML algorithms could help identify biomarkers that offer greater insight into pathophysiological processes, revealing variables that conventional methodologies may overlook. In turn, it leads to more refined taxonomy. For example, supervised deep learning has shown potential to surpass expert clinicians in psychiatric diagnostics through enhanced diagnostic precision utilizing diverse data source amalgamation [12]. Nienke et al. have demonstrated the use of an analysis framework using natural language processing (NLP) and computational modeling to analyze the complex symptomatology and heterogeneity of neuropsychiatric disorders [13]. Other studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs)—such as GPT-4, Llama 2, and the more recent Gemini—can significantly outperform physicians in diagnostic accuracy, in some cases achieving nearly double the accuracy [12]. By incorporating diverse data streams that encompass genetic, neuroimaging, behavioral, and laboratory-based data, comprehensive data amalgamation can be used to elucidate dimensional nuances within diagnoses and often overlapping symptomatology across diverse psychiatric disorders [14]. This framework shows new clinical subtypes and reveals patterns of misdiagnosis, thereby enhancing our understanding of these diseases and providing a valuable resource for future research in psychiatry. Cluster analysis has been utilized extensively in mental health research as a tool to reduce interindividual heterogeneity through the identification of homogeneous subgroups within the population under study. In the field of psychiatric research, various clustering techniques have been employed. This includes center-based partitioning (e.g., K-means and K-medoids), hierarchical clustering, density-based clustering, and model-based clustering (e.g., finite mixture model and latent class analysis) [15]. Notable advancements include the development of a multi-view clustering approach based on a nonparametric Bayesian mixture model for depression subtyping [16], the integration of fuzzy C-means and Gaussian Mixture Models to identify ambiguous data points in schizophrenia subtyping [17], and the combination of deep autoencoders with clustering ensembles [18]. Resampling techniques, such as cross-validation, are employed to select optimal parameters and evaluate generalization capabilities. Clustering algorithms can be combined with clinical variables to identify subtypes, and the resulting clusters can be evaluated for meaningful associations with clinical outcomes [15]. Additionally, AI-driven clustering methods enhance the identification of antipsychotic side effects by grouping medications based on receptor binding profiles [19]. By refining drug classifications to reflect side-effect profiles, AI promotes more personalized prescribing, particularly for patients sensitive to certain adverse reactions, improving treatment outcomes in psychiatric care. However, because of the unsupervised nature of clustering, the true performance of these methods is often uncertain. The Dimensional Neuroimaging Endophenotype (DNE) framework, supported by the AI clustering of neuroimaging data, has been shown to effectively capture disease heterogeneity, enabling the identification of distinct subtypes as well as delineation of continuous dimensions of disease progression [20]. These findings have been validated across several psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease [21, 22], schizophrenia [17, 23,24,25,26], major depressive disorder [27,28,29], and autism spectrum disorder [30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37]. These investigations have consistently identified biologically valued subtypes and dimensions. Furthermore, DNEs have been linked to genetic underpinnings and clinical outcomes, demonstrating its potential value as a biomarker for early detection, treatment selection and outcome. Although confounding factors and the sparseness of longitudinal and multi-omics data integration remain challenging, DNE is proposed as... [Contenido truncado]",

Learn More\n\nShares of Nvidia (NVDA 1.69%) have been impacted by several factors, including increasing macroeconomic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, ongoing tariff wars, export controls, and rising competition from Chinese companies in the past few months.\n\nHowever, the recent earnings performance -- including its recent impressive result in the fiscal first quarter of 2026 -- demonstrates why investors should not let the short-term noise distract them from the company's long-term growth prospects.\n\nNvidia's first quarter fiscal 2026 earnings performance (ending April 27) validates its position as the clear leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) -powered hardware, software, and infrastructure services market. Revenue soared 69% year-over-year to $44.1 billion, while data center revenue  surged 73% year-over-year to $39.1 billion in the first quarter.\n\nNvidia's dominance in the AI chip market, where it still controls a more than 80% share, should remain unchallenged at least for the next few years. The company's latest Grace Blackwell 200 (GB200) graphics processing units (GPUs) enable organizations to run computationally heavy reasoning AI models with 25 times higher performance and at a twentieth of the cost of Hopper H100 chips.\n\nThe Blackwell ramp-up has been the fastest product launch in Nvidia's history and accounted for nearly 70% of data center compute revenues in the recent quarter. Major hyperscalers are already deploying nearly 72,000 Blackwell GPUs weekly across their data centers and are planning to further ramp output in this quarter.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia is sampling GB300 systems at major cloud service providers and expects production shipments to commence by the end of the second quarter. While these systems have the same architecture, physical footprint, and mechanical and electrical specifications as GB200, they offer 50% more high-bandwidth memory capacity and a 50% increase in inference computing performance. Hence, cloud service providers can transition from GB200 to GB300 systems while benefiting from higher performance\n\nNvidia's software ecosystem has also become a strong moat, ensuring that customers will find it prohibitively costly to switch to competitors' chips. The company's comprehensive CUDA parallel programming platform is currently used by 5.9 million developers to accelerate GPUs for various general-purpose applications effectively. CUDA is currently used to accelerate all AI models and over 4,400 applications. Subsequently, CUDA helps prevent significant infrastructure investments from becoming obsolete in an exceptionally fast-evolving market.\n\nAdditionally, the company launched its TensorRT software package for inference (real-time deployment of trained AI models) optimization and the TensorRT-LLM software library to ensure the fast and efficient running of large language models.\n\nNvidia partnered with Humain, a newly launched AI company owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, to build AI factories with 18,000 of its latest GB300 Blackwell chips in the first deployment phase. Nvidia is also playing a key role in the Stargate Project, through which OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle have said they plan to invest $500 billion into U.S.-based AI infrastructure over the next four years.\n\nIn its fiscal 2025, which ended Jan. 26, the chipmaker's revenues grew by 114% to $130.5 billion.  While analysts are projecting lower revenue growth rates for future years, the consensus expectation is still for the company to grow quickly. Nvidia's revenues are forecast to increase by 52.8% and 23.9% in its fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2027, respectively. And the company's already off to a good start by recording 69% revenue growth in Q1 of fiscal 2026.\n\nIn that context, it is reasonable to expect Nvidia to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next decade. If it does, it would wind up with about $808 billion in revenues in its fiscal 2035.\n\nNvidia reported an exceptionally high net income margin of 55.8%  in its fiscal 2025. The company has been able to steadily expand its margins in the past couple of years, largely due to its dominance in the AI market. Even if we assume that it will have to accept some margin contraction due to increasing competition and scale, it is reasonable to expect it to produce a net income margin of nearly 27.9% -- its 10-year median margin -- in fiscal 2035. With a top line of $808 billion, that would give it a net income of around $225 billion that year.\n\nNvidia is trading at around 32.6 times forward earnings. Analysts have projected 5-year forward P/E multiple of 23.5x for Nvidia. Assuming this valuation multiple for the next 10 years , the company can reach a market value of $5.29 trillion by 2035.\n\nHence, the company is well positioned to cross the $5 trillion market capitalization, even under conservative expectations. There are reasons to suspect its market value could grow even higher, too -- consider Nvidia's upcoming AI initiatives, such as Sovereign AI, agentic AI, and physical AI.\n\nNvidia is also benefiting from the increasing demand for high-performance chips in gaming and AI PCs. Gaming revenue rose 42% year-over-year to $3.8 billion in the first quarter, driven by strong adoption of Blackwell architecture systems from gamers, creators, and AI enthusiasts.\n\nEnterprise AI is also becoming a significant growth catalyst, with Nvidia bringing AI-powered storage, computing, and networking capabilities directly to corporate environments. The company's RTX Pro, DGX Spark and DGX Station enterprise AI systems are targeting the $500 billion market opportunity. Nvidia's Omniverse and robotics platforms are also powering factory automation and humanoid robotic systems.\n\nWith all that in mind, long-term investors should consider picking up at least a small stake in Nvidia to profit from the AI wave over the next decade.\n\nManali Pradhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.
