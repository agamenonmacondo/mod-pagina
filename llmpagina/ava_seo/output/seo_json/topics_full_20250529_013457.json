        "title": "Feature - Protein, price, perception reviving cow's milk in the US",
        "content": "Economic factors remain pivotal in shaping consumer behaviour, and here cow’s milk retains a decisive edge - Just Food columnist Victor Martino suggests.\n\nAfter decades of declining consumption, cow’s milk and its value-added dairy counterparts are experiencing a notable resurgence in the US.\n\nWhat was once seen as a shrinking category is now showing robust growth. The key drivers behind this revival are the 3 P’s – protein, price and perception. Together, these three factors have reversed a long-term slide and put cow’s milk prominently back on American grocery shelves and in consumers’ refrigerators.\n\nAdditionally, speciality milks – particularly lactose-free and other value-added targeted formulations – are expanding the market, allowing dairy brands and the dairy industry to reach wider consumer segments.\n\nRecent data from grocery industry market research firm Circana provides valuable insights into this comeback, showing sustained growth in cow’s milk and value-added dairy product sales through late 2024 and into early 2025. The dairy sector’s relatively newfound ability to innovate and address evolving consumer needs has proven critical to this success.\n\nIn 2024, US consumption of whole milk rose by 3.2%, which was only the second increase since the 1970s, while consumption of plant-based milks fell 5.9%, according to data from Circana. Sales of dairy milk overall were up 1.9%, and sales of raw milk leaped by 17.6%.\n\nIt was only a few years ago that many industry analysts and pundits were saying that plant-based milks would soon disrupt cow’s milk and become the future of dairy. That clearly isn’t happening. Cow’s milk is back in a major way for three key reasons – protein, price and perception.\n\nDon’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.\n\nIn today’s nutrition-conscious world, protein is king. Consumers across age groups are increasingly prioritising high-protein foods to support muscle maintenance, weight management and overall health. Cow’s milk is a standout source of complete protein (meaning it contains all nine essential amino acids), something many plant-based milk alternatives struggle to match.\n\nAccording to Circana data, cow’s milk-based value-added dairy products rich in protein – such as Greek yogurt, cottage cheese and kefir – have seen some of the strongest growth within the dairy aisle. For example, cottage cheese sales surged by nearly 17% year-over-year in 2024, a growth partly fueled by innovative new formats like flavoured cottage cheese, cottage cheese ice cream and convenient snacking options that appeal to younger consumers seeking convenient protein sources.\n\nPosts about cottage cheese as a protein heavyweight are also all over social media platforms, particularly TikTok, which has aided its dramatic rise in sales over the last couple of years.\n\nMoreover, with the rise of GLP-1 medications for weight management, consumers are increasingly attuned to balancing high protein intake with low-sugar consumption. Cow’s milk-based dairy fits neatly into this trend, as many products provide a protein-rich, nutrient-dense option with limited added sugars. Circana’s research shows that consumers on these medications often gravitate toward dairy items because they help meet their nutritional goals while avoiding excessive carbs or sugars.\n\nProtein’s central role in fitness and wellness culture also boosts fluid milk’s appeal among athletes and active consumers. Cow’s milk’s natural blend of protein, calcium, and vitamin D makes it a post-workout favourite and an easy addition to balanced diets.\n\nEconomic factors remain pivotal in shaping consumer behaviour, and here cow’s milk retains a decisive edge. Despite inflationary pressures in recent years, milk remains one of the most affordable sources of essential nutrients like calcium, potassium, and vitamin B12.\n\nCircana’s data shows that private-label dairy sales have hit record highs, increasing 3.9% to $271bn overall. Within dairy specifically, private-label dollar sales reached $33.7bn for the year ended January 2024, with unit sales climbing 2%. This indicates consumers are consciously choosing value-driven brands that deliver quality comparable to national labels but at lower prices.\n\nThis price advantage becomes particularly important for families seeking nutritious food options on tight budgets. Whereas many plant-based milk alternatives command a premium, often costing 20-50% more per gallon than cow’s milk, dairy remains accessible. This affordability sustains milk’s role as a dietary staple for millions of Americans.\n\nAdditionally, the rise of value-added dairy products like shredded cheese and drinkable yogurts that are competitively priced further supports growth. Consumers can enjoy protein-rich dairy without breaking the bank, a crucial factor during economic uncertainty.\n\nConsumer perceptions around food have evolved considerably. Today’s shoppers increasingly seek products they perceive as natural, clean, simple and trustworthy. Cow’s milk fits this profile well. Unlike some ultra-processed or heavily formulated plant-based alternatives, milk is straightforward – just milk, with very little processing or additives.\n\nThis simplicity resonates with people longing for authentic, “real” foods amidst a complex food environment. There is also a growing appreciation for dairy’s long-standing place in American culture and nutrition.\n\nMoreover, the dairy industry has invested heavily in transparency and sustainability initiatives in recent years, addressing concerns around environmental impact and animal welfare. These efforts have helped rehabilitate dairy’s image, especially among Millennials and Gen Z consumers who care deeply about ethics and sustainability.\n\nInterestingly, Circana’s research suggests younger generations are treating cow’s milk as “the hot new thing”.\n\nAfter years of milk alternatives dominating the conversation (over the last two years, whole milk has been getting a higher volume of Google Search inquiries than plant-based milk, for example), Gen Z and Gen Alpha consumers are rediscovering dairy products as a source of wholesome nutrition and comfort. This shift is partly cultural, a pushback against the proliferation of artificial or overly complex food products.\n\nBrand and industry marketing campaigns emphasizing milk’s natural origin, nutritional benefits, and evolving sustainability efforts have further improved perception, fueling renewed interest.\n\nRecognising the prevalence of lactose intolerance and other dietary restrictions, the dairy industry has innovated to include lactose-free and reduced-lactose options.\n\nThese products retain the nutritional benefits of traditional milk while eliminating discomfort for sensitive individuals. The availability of such options has broadened the consumer base, contributing to the overall growth in milk sales.\n\nCircana’s data shows that speciality milks are growing at double-digit rates, outpacing traditional milk in many markets. Lactose-free milk, A2 milk (containing only A2 beta-casein protein), and other niche formulations like organic or grass-fed options provide consumers with choice and personalisation. These speciality milk varieties are playing a major role in the cow’s milk sales renaissance in the US.\n\nAdditionally, the rise of dairy yogurts fortified with probiotics and functional ingredients aligns with growing consumer interest in gut health and immunity.\n\nCultured dairy products –which include yogurt, kefir, and fermented milk drinks – have seen an 8.2% sales increase, hitting $11.2bn in 2024, according to Circana. Their appeal combines tradition with modern wellness trends, making dairy relevant to contemporary lifestyles.\n\nSpeciality milks also cater to convenience, offering ready-to-drink or portable options that fit busy schedules. This innovation helps dairy compete with alternative beverages targeting the same consumer needs.\n\nRaw milk – unpasteurised and unhomogenised – is seeing a surge in sales in states where it’s legally available. While still niche, it appeals to consumers seeking what they describe as “a more natural and authentic dairy experience”.\n\nEnthusiasts say they value raw milk for its richer flavour and perceived health benefits, fitting into the broader trend of favouring minimally processed foods. Though raw milk sales remain small compared to conventional milk, their steady growth reflects consumer interest in simpler, less processed options.\n\nRaw milk also has a powerful ally – Health and Human Services Director Robert F. Kennedy Jr. – in the nation’s capital. Kennedy and his MAHA (Make America Healthy Again) movement, which is now affiliated with President Donald Trump’s MAGA (Make America Great Again) coalition, are major proponents of raw milk and want to see it legalised nationally.\n\nThe future of cow’s milk and its value-added products looks promising, though not without competition. The category’s rebound is grounded in lasting consumer shifts toward protein-rich, affordable and more cleaner natural foods. Products like lactose-free milk, high-protein yogurts and even raw milk show dairy’s ability to evolve and meet modern demands, which is something that was lacking only a few years ago.\n\nStill, growth isn’t guaranteed. The industry and brands must continue innovating while addressing concerns about sustainability, animal welfare and transparency. Younger consumers especially want food that aligns with both their health goals and their values.\n\nThe key for brands and the industry as a whole will be staying nimble and relevant in a crowded marketplace. But if traditional dairy continues to adapt, the outlook is strong. Cow’s milk is no longer declining – it’s transforming. And in my analysis that transformation positions it well for a healthy future.",

        "title": "Interview: Brynwood Partners eyes more M&A after Chef Boyardee",
        "content": "The US private-equity firm has just struck its largest acquisition, buying Chef Boyardee from Conagra Brands for $600m. US private-equity firm Brynwood Partners has announced two significant deals in the last two months – the acquisition of pasta and Italian meals brand Chef Boyardee from Conagra Brands and the disposal of Sunny D juices maker Harvest Hill Beverage Company to Castillo Hermanos. Brynwood Partners is the buy-out house behind US manufacturer Hometown Foods, which it founded in 2018 to buy a collection of assets from JM Smucker and has since built through M&A. Just Food caught up with Henk Hartong III, Brynwood Partners’ chairman and CEO, to discuss the two transactions, his plans for Chef Boyardee and his thoughts on the wider M&A environment. Henk Hartong III (HH): We raised our ninth fund in 2023. That’s a $750m fund. I had been working on the divestiture of Harvest Hill, which was our biggest portfolio company and owned by Brynwood VIII, a previous fund to our current fund. We started working probably since the fall of 2024 on the divestiture of Harvest Hill. We ended up divesting in that business for over $1.4bn. With Harvest Hill leaving, I was looking at the balance of the portfolio and thinking with Hometown Food that we wanted to have an anchor that would provide us with scale. We got the agreement of our limited partners to have an acquisition of Hometown Food, a collection of iconic American brands – Pillsbury, Hungry Jack, Martha White, De Waffelbakkers, Arrowhead Mills – into fund nine because fund eight, which was then fund seven, the owners of it were at the end of their lives. We were able to do that; we completed that transaction first, so that Hometown Foods is owned by Brynwood IX and the second leg was to get Chef Boyardee, which we were able to negotiate and secure from Conagra. Those two businesses will be merged together at the closing, which we expect will happen in early June. HH: That story was accurate. We did explore that. We didn’t get the outcome or offers that we were looking for and, at that point, we decided to continue to drive the performance of the business. We have a bunch of different components within that company that have had nice performance. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. The nice part about the Chef Boyardee business is it’s big, it’s predominantly a US business, which suits very well our combination of assets already in Hometown Food and it’s a single manufacturing operation in central Pennsylvania. Our predominant ambient manufacturing for the current business sits in Toledo, Ohio, about 500 miles away. There’s some pretty good business synergy combinations. The moment you buy something out of a big company you end up with freight and manufacturing dis-synergies. In this case, we actually created synergies because we’re going to be able to pool our two ambient businesses of really significant scale together to ship our customers all the products on the same truck. HH: It’s not that dissimilar from Sunny D. When we bought Sunny D in 2015 for less than $200m and people said, ‘What are you doing, Henk? Its best days are behind it. The heyday was with Procter and Gamble.’ I said, ‘This business has been fundamentally under-managed. It’s a great, iconic, American brand that has lost its way.’ Our whole investment strategy is providing our operating skills and insights with the retailer and supplier and manufacturing know-how. Those connections and relationships can help us unlock value if we can get a business in our hands that we feel has the potential to respond to that level of therapy, triage and initiative. If you look at that business at the time of acquisition, it was $250m in sales and, when we closed on it yesterday, the TTM [trailing twelve months] sales were almost $550m on a business that people had started their sentence, ‘Sunny D? Oh, I used to drink that when I was a kid.’ When you ask someone about Chef Boyardee: ‘Oh, I used to eat that when I was a teenager or whatever’ but you got to get the ‘used to’ out of there. That’s going to require some work, right? HH: We’re not going to do that by just selling the current format. It’s going to have to go into different applications in the store. We’re not going to do anything to change the existing offerings. We may look to improve them if we feel that’s the appropriate fix but the core offerings would be the core offerings. That brand is so well known. I would argue it’s better known than Sunny D. Conagra, nothing against their efforts but big companies make choices of what are core brands and, when something’s determined to be non-core and non-strategic, they manage it for cash. That means that business does not get the things it needs that respond to trends in the market. We will correct that quickly. We’ll look at the adjacencies within the category that we’re in and find ways to compete in different parts of the store. Chef Boyardee has the legs to run. We just need to give it the resources to get there quickly. We’re selling in the canned meals, cup meals sector but we’re not in skillet meals, for example. We should be. We’re not in shelf-stable trays. We’re not in shelf-stable cups, microwavable cups. We’re not in refrigerated, ready-to-eat, high-quality meals, which is a big segment of the store that consumers are often going to for slightly differentiated eating experiences. The foodservice business hasn’t been a priority. We think there’s a big application for foodservice. We have a long list of go-gets. What does that take to get into those categories? Capital investment. Marketing initiatives. It takes new product, R&D work. That wasn’t getting funded by the current owner of the business not because it wasn’t a good idea but because this was not a growth brand for them and that’s what we have to change. We did the same thing with Sunny D. The brand has the legs to run. We just need to give it the resources to get there quickly. HH: It’s a good question. We obviously were aware of what was being proposed from a regulatory perspective. We were mindful of that as we looked at this opportunity. Fortunately, the larger companies have been more proactive in terms of taking some of these voluntary initiatives to make adjustments. Whether they’re merited or not to be made, they’ve been doing them anyway. We are confident that, whatever regulations will come down, that these products are not going to have substantial, if any, modifications required. Where does this go from here, that I can’t opine on but, from what I can see in terms of legislative or regulatory requirement changes, I don’t anticipate that this is going to affect the Chef Boyardee business in any meaningful way. The proposed regulations are banning certain ingredients that, quite frankly, I don’t think they’ve determined to be unsafe or unhealthy The tariffs, on the other hand, are far more problematic in terms of managing rising costs in the time when we’re looking to try to control inflation and grocery prices. A lot of the initiatives are catching areas of the economy that are unintended, I think, from the administration’s application of these tariffs. They don’t intend to catch steel cans for food packaging when you’re putting these wild tariffs on steel but they are catching it because 90% of the steel tin plate that’s required to service the US manufacturing businesses is produced outside of the US at the moment. The proposed regulations are banning certain ingredients that, quite frankly, I don’t think they’ve determined to be unsafe or unhealthy because, if they were, they would already be regulated by the FDA, and they’re not. And yet, at the same time, you can buy tobacco and alcohol, there’s plenty of other things that are known to be harmful that they’re not posing bans on, so the double standard, in my judgment, seems to be quite significant. It appears to be a political opportunity, not something that’s applied equally across all regulatory decisions that have been made, across anything that people are able to buy or consume. Putting that aside, one benefit for someone in the M&A business is, look at the times where industry has been afflicted with a common set of problems. The four times I can remember – 9/11, the great financial crisis, coronavirus and now the current political instability – at those four moments in time, businesses were afflicted with the same set of problems and, what I found for Brynwood is, when we’re dealing with that, our opportunity to outperform the market is always better. I compare it to duplicate bridge, I always tell our investment team. Duplicate bridge, everybody has the same cards but... [Contenido truncado]",

        "content": "On the second day of the upcoming Sustainable Cosmetics Summit in New York City, CosmeticsDesign US will moderate a panel discussion as part of Session Three: Future Trends. This session will examine emerging developments with the potential to drive sustainability across the beauty and personal care sector, focusing on topics like regenerative agriculture, next-generation recycling technologies, the use of innovative, lower-impact materials, and the growing role of artificial intelligence in advancing product personalization.\n\nThe Sustainability Merits of New Technologies panel will bring together executives and innovators from across the industry to assess how new technologies are contributing to and challenging sustainability goals. Speakers include Sourabh Sharma of FIG OR OUT, Mehmet Bereket of PulpoAR, Chad Conger of GlycosBio, Tom Szaky of TerraCycle, and Vikram Pandit of Phycus Biotechnologies Inc.\n\nThe panel will focus on practical applications, measurable benefits, and the broader implications of tech-driven change in the cosmetics industry. We spoke with the panelists ahead of the summit to gather some of their most significant insights, which will inform the discussion.\n\nVikram Pandit (Phycus Biotechnologies Inc.): We’re seeing significant impacts by using biotechnology and precision fermentation to make ingredients. As a result, we’re seeing a shift from petrochemical-based and plant-extracted ingredients to lab-cultivated actives using precision fermentation.\n\nThese technologies offer consistent purity, lower environmental impact, and can unlock rare or previously unsustainable ingredients. Part of this also means being able to use novel starting materials from agriculture or food waste, like waste oils, coffee grounds, or wood saw dust, to create high-value cosmetic actives\n\nOf course, AI-powered product formulation and personalization are also taking place. Whether this means using AI to design customized skincare routines, predict ingredient synergies, and develop novel formulations more efficiently. It enables both personalization for consumers and speed-to-market for brands.\n\nAdvances in encapsulation and delivery systems are also occurring, which improve the stability and efficacy of active ingredients. Helping them penetrate the skin better and release over time. Of course, this can mean using fewer ingredients, which also has a sustainability element.\n\nMehmet Bereket (PulpoAR): Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing product development through consumer preference analysis, and personalized recommendations and formulations. A number of brands use AI for skin analysis and custom foundation matching, demonstrating how algorithms can reduce waste from unsuitable products while optimizing ingredient efficacy.\n\nVikram Pandit (Phycus Biotechnologies Inc.): Broadly, we see a lower carbon footprint by using fermentation-based and upcycled ingredients. This is a result of less land, water, and energy than traditional agriculture or petrochemical processes, which significantly reduce emissions.\n\nResource efficiency is another aspect, as upcycled ingredients give a second life to waste streams, maximizing resource utilization and reducing landfill burden. These waste streams have been present for a long time, allowing for a consistent and scalable supply that is not subject to seasonal variability.\n\nOf course, cleaner labels and claims that are free from controversial chemicals also support brand marketability and positioning.\n\nMehmet Bereket (PulpoAR): AI-driven personalization reduces product waste by ensuring better consumer-product matching. When products are selected or formulated specifically for individual needs based on accurate recommendations, there’s less of a likelihood to end up with unsuitable products.\n\nSourabh Sharma (FIG OR OUT): A key consideration is balancing innovation with transparency and consumer education. Many of these technologies operate behind the scenes, yet consumers, especially Gen Z and Gen Alpha, are demanding visibility into how products are made and what makes them “clean” or “green.”\n\nThere’s a risk of greenwashing if brands adopt tech-forward sourcing or formulation without clear communication. As someone who has led thought leadership and marketing for sustainable beauty products, I see an opportunity for storytelling to bridge the gap: demystifying biotech, celebrating ingredient traceability, and using social media as a platform for both education and advocacy.\n\nNew technologies are only as powerful as the trust they build with consumers, and it’s up to marketers, creatives, and sustainability champions to bring that trust to life.\n\nChad Conger (GlycosBio): One thing that has dawned on me more recently is how often cosmetic products serve as the first line of care for people noticing a change in their health. This is probably most notable in the skin.\n\nWhether it’s early eczema, irritation, or acne, consumers typically turn to over-the-counter products before seeking clinical treatment. That gives us, as brands, formulators and ingredient innovators, a unique responsibility—and opportunity—to help improve the lives of those customers on their personal journey.\n\nWe’re also seeing a clear path toward personalization. With platforms using AI and advanced production technology, we can now design products tailored to specific skin types, barrier conditions, or microbiome profiles—moving from one-size-fits-all to solutions that actually meet the skin where it is.\n\nUltimately, innovation in cosmetics isn’t just about what’s new—it’s about what’s needed. And right now, what’s needed are technologies that deliver better outcomes: for skin, for health, and for the environment.\n\nFor more information on the upcoming Summit or to register, click here.",
