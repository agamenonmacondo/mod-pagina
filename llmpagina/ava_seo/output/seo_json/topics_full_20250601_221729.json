        "title": "We‚Äôre About To Talk To Dolphins‚Ä¶ But Are We Ready To Hear The Truth?",
        "content": "Inspired by Google Translate, a new AI may soon let us talk to dolphins. But once they understand us ‚Äî what will they say?\n\nA groundbreaking new project is underway to make interspecies communication a reality. Google DeepMind, in collaboration with the Wild Dolphin Project, has developed an experimental artificial intelligence named DolphinGemma, designed to interpret and eventually replicate the intricate vocalizations of dolphins. This initiative could allow humans to finally ‚Äúspeak‚Äù with one of the most intelligent marine species on Earth.\n\nDolphins are known for their high intelligence and rich acoustic communication, including clicks, whistles, and burst-pulse sounds. These vocalizations have fascinated researchers for decades, leading to the discovery of individual ‚Äúsignature whistles‚Äù that function like names, especially between mothers and calves. Other sounds, such as buzzes and squawks, appear in contexts like courtship or aggression.\n\nBy training a large language model on a comprehensive database of dolphin audio recordings and corresponding behaviors, the AI could begin to detect patterns‚Äîjust as human-oriented LLMs predict and generate text.\n\nAccording to the project, this capability is essential to understanding the ‚Äúnext likely sound‚Äù and eventually deciphering what dolphins are trying to communicate.\n\nThe research team isn‚Äôt stopping at passive interpretation. They‚Äôre actively working on generating sounds that mimic dolphin whistles. These are then introduced in the wild, using Pixel smartphones, to see if dolphins respond and associate them with specific objects or activities, such as particular types of seaweed they prefer.\n\nIf successful, this feedback loop could lead to two-way communication‚Äîan unprecedented breakthrough in marine biology. The idea is inspired by human language learning tools like Google Translate but adapted for a non-human species. The potential implications span from conservation to entirely new forms of ecological understanding.\n\nüö®GOOGLE BUILT AN AI TO TALK TO DOLPHINS So here‚Äôs a sentence you weren‚Äôt expecting:Google made a dolphin translator.After 40 years of listening to dolphin clicks, squeaks, and underwater gossip, researchers have teamed up with Google to launch DolphinGemma, the first AI‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/puCfMhjrxf\n\nWhile dolphins are often depicted as playful and friendly creatures, researchers are cautiously optimistic about what this technology might reveal. As the Metro report highlights, ‚Äúwe might not like what they have to say.‚Äù This sentiment stems from known cases of aggressive dolphin behavior, including reports of attacks on swimmers attributed to frustration or territorial defense.\n\nEven more sobering is the possibility that dolphins could use their newfound communication channel to deliver pointed messages about human behavior. From ocean pollution to the disruptive noise of boat engines, our actions have long affected marine life. If dolphins truly gain a ‚Äúvoice‚Äù in the conversation, their critiques might be as sharp as they are overdue.\n\nNicknamed a ‚ÄúDr. Dolittle-style AI‚Äù, DolphinGemma represents a fusion of advanced technology and long-term marine observation. The project is rooted in years of underwater video and audio data collected by the Wild Dolphin Project, whose scientists have monitored dolphin pods in their natural habitat.\n\nThis partnership with Google DeepMind has transformed that rich archive into a training ground for a powerful algorithm capable of parsing complex vocal behavior. It‚Äôs a project that reflects growing interest in using AI not only for human convenience, but also for expanding our understanding of the non-human world.",

        "content": "Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, joins 'America's Newsroom' along with 15-year-old AI deep fake victim Elliston Berry to discuss the importance of the 'Take It Down' bill, warning the issue is 'rising every day.'\n\nEvangelical leaders praised President Donald Trump for his leadership on artificial intelligence (\"AI\") in an open letter published last week, while cautioning him to ensure the technology is developed responsibly.\n\nDubbing Trump the \"AI President,\" the religious leaders wrote that they believe Trump is there by \"Divine Providence\" to guide the world on the future of AI.\n\nThe signatories said they are \"pro-science\" and fully support the advancement of technology which benefits their own ministries around the world.\n\n\"We are also pro-economic prosperity and economic leadership for America and our friends.¬†We do not want to see the AI revolution slowing, but we want to see the AI revolution accelerating responsibly,\" the letter says.\n\nA group of faith leaders penned an open letter to President Trump warning about the ethical implications of unchecked, rapidly developing artificial intelligence. (iStock)\n\nThe faith leaders warned about the technology advancing at an out-of-control pace that could cause \"potential peril\" for mankind.\n\nThey cited concerns raised by industry leaders Elon Musk, Bill Gates and Sam Altman, warning that AI would take jobs away in most industries and could eventually cause human suffering.\n\nThe U.S. should not hesitate in its efforts to \"win the AI race,\" the pastors told Trump, but cautioned that victory mustn‚Äôt come at any cost.\n\n\"As people of faith, we believe we should rapidly develop powerful AI tools that help cure diseases and solve practical problems, but not autonomous smarter-than-human machines that nobody knows how to control,\" the letter states.\n\nElon Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have both warned about the potential dangers of AI. (Getty Images)\n\n\"The spiritual implications of creating intelligence that may one day surpass human capabilities raises profound theological and ethical questions that must be thoughtfully considered with wisdom. One does not have to be religious to recognize religion as a type of compounding wisdom over the centuries, and virtually all religious traditions warn against a world where work is no longer necessary or where human beings can live their lives without any guardrails,\" the leaders wrote.\n\nThey urged Trump to develop an advisory council or delegate authority to an existing agency or council \"which would convene leaders who will pay attention especially not only to what AI CAN do but also what it SHOULD do.\"\n\nA group of 18 pastors and faith leaders signed on to the letter, which was spearheaded by prominent Christian leaders, Rev. Johnnie Moore, president of the Congress of Christian Leaders, and Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, President of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Council.\n\nThe letter comes weeks after Pope Leo XIV compared the advancements in AI to the Industrial Revolution and called on the Catholic Church to confront the challenges AI poses to human dignity, labor and society.\n\nPope Leo XIV addressed AI's challenges for humanity. (Vatican Media)\n\nIn April, Trump signed an executive order to implement AI education in the classroom to create \"educational and workforce development opportunities for America‚Äôs youth.\"\n\nThe AI order,¬†Trump's latest pro-AI measure,¬†established a White House task force for AI and education that will work with federal agencies and the private sector to help draft AI programs for schools.\n\nFox News' Alec Schemmel and Emma Colton contributed to this report.\n\nKristine Parks is a reporter for Fox News Digital.
